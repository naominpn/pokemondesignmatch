<h3>About</h3>
<p>This a design match test using ONLY HTML and CSS. No CSS libraries, no React.js</p>

<br>
<p>Total Run Time ~ 3 Hours</p>
    <ul>
        <li> HTML markup time: 20 minutes </li>
        <li> CSS time: 170 minutes </li>
        <li> ~ Optional ~ Mobile Responsive: 3 hours of messing around</li>
    </ul>


<h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The triangle shapes on the top and bottom of the design
              <p><b>Solution:</b> CSS drawings and a bit of pixel pushing </p>
              <p><b>Problem:</b> I usually prefer to use all my measurements in percentage however this would moved the triangle when the window size changed. </p></li>
        <li> the dashed border around the image
            <p><b>Comment:</b> At first, I was confused and thought it was a border for my img-container class. However upon thinking about it a bit more, I found a solution to add a div with it's own class of img-border. </p> </li>
        <li> unusual snake layout of the cards
            <p><b>Comment:</b> Not really difficult, I've just never used nth child before. I already knew how to tackle this challenge; this took around 10 minutes to style. </p>
         </li>
    </ul>
