Total Run Time ~ 3 Hours
    <br> HTML markup time: 20 minutes
    <br> CSS time: 170 minutes;


<b>Challenges:</b> 
   - The triangle shapes on the top and bottom of the design.
<br> <b>Solution:</b> CSS drawings and a bit of pixel pushing. 
<br><b>Problem:</b> I usually prefer to use all my measurements in percentage however this would moved the triangle when the window size changed. 

   - the dashed border around the image
<br><b>Comment:</b> At first, I was confused and thought it was a border for my img-container class. However upon thinking about it a bit more, I found a solution to add a div with it's own class of img-border. 

   - Unusual staircase layout of the cards
<br><b>Comment:</b> Not really difficult just never used nth child before. I already new how to tackle this challenge; this took around 10 minutes to figure out.
