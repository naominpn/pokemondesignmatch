Total Run Time ~ 3 Hours
    HTML markup time: 20 minutes
    CSS time: 170 minutes;


Challenges: 
    - The triangle shapes on the top and bottom of the design; 
Solution: CSS drawings and a bit of pixel pushing. 
Problem: I usually prefer to use all my measurements in percentage however this would moved the triangle when the window size changed. 

    - the dashed border around the image
Comment: At first, I was confused and thought it was a border for my img-container class. However upon thinking about it a bit more, I found a solution to add a div with it's own class of as img-border. 

    - Unusual staircase layout of the cards
Comment: Not really difficult just never used nth child before. I already new how to tackle this challenge; this took around 10 minutes to figure out.
